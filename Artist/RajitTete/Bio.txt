I am Rajit Tete, from Delhi. I am a Software Engineering student at Delhi Technological University and have been drawing/sketching as a hobby for more than 10 years now. I started off with making basic landscapes and character sketching, but now I majorly work on realistic portraits. My art is clearly defined through pencil colours, graphite, and charcoal portraits, and through my art, I let my creativity run wild. Taking inspiration from everything around me, I try to make whatever I draw as realistic as possible, moving one step closer to bringing my art to life. Check out my art account @tetexart on Instagram for more of my works.
