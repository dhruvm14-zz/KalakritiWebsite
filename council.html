            <h1>Abhishek Soren</h1>
            <p>
              Hey, I'm Abhishek Soren, a sophomore pursuing Btech in Computer
              Engineering. Since my first year, I've been a part of Kalakriti.
              Being a part of this society, I've gained a lot of experience and
              knowledge for which I'm very grateful. Now I certainly can say
              that I've learned life skills that will also help me in the
              future. From my first year, I've been managing the society's
              Instagram handle and later on started creating posts for Spinback.
              I was fortunate enough to get the position of PR Co-head. And now
              that I'm one of the shortlisted candidates for the position of
              Secretary, I feel really obliged. I've always tried my best and
              gave my best for the betterment of society. Be it sharing my views
              and ideas for any event that society is preparing to organize, I'd
              always be enthusiastic and always be for the same. For a long
              time, I've been eager to improve my managing skills, and being the
              PR Co-head undoubtedly helped a lot in that aspect. But now, I'd
              like to put all those skills that I've honed in the past year into
              work. There were situations where I did some things wrong. I took
              responsibility and rectified those mistakes. Also, I'm the kind of
              person who works systematically, so becoming the Secretary, this
              habit of mine will surely come out in handy. Also, I'd like to add
              that I'm really passionate about my work and would even skip my
              sleep if the work is not yet complete. I'd try to complete it
              today or as soon as possible but not procrastinate. I remember one
              time creating content for the page even though I had tests
              non-stop. I am dedicated to my work and a hard worker. I forgot to
              mention that I'm always looking for abstract ideas for kinds of
              stuff here and there. And that's how I stand unique from the
              others. You can simply do the same thing, but why not try
              something new maybe it would turn out good. Perhaps not, but
              you'll surely gain the experience. There's no negative in that.
              People often don't like my ideas, but that negative feedback makes
              me even more motivated so that I can get their approval even after
              trying maybe ten times, and then maybe 100 times, and so on. But
              that won't make me falter. I'll still give my 100 percent. With
              that, I'd conclude this SOP. And even if I'm not selected for the
              position, I'd always give my best wishes to the one who does get
              selected. And I'd like to improve those things which I lacked and
              will work on them. But if I do get selected, I would give the
              position my all to the best of my abilities. With all that "Always
              Keep Smiling and keep on grooming yourself that'd even make your
              past self proud." Thank You
            </p>

            <h1>Akshit Kaushik</h1>
            <p>
              Akshit Kaushik this side (2nd year, EE). I would like to put
              forward my candidature for the post of General Secretary of the
              Society. I have been the part of Kalakriti right from my first
              year and ever since I’ve learned a lot from everyone in this
              amazing family. I’ve had help, from my seniors, my colleagues and
              my juniors who now I’ve come to associate with as closest friends.
              All this was made possible by many efforts from the part of
              everyone I came across. I’ve worked for the society in many
              aspects. The past year had been very hard because of the sudden
              Covid-19 outbreak yet this can’t stop us from organizing online
              webinars , competitions and various online art programs and I can
              proudly say that I work hard with my friends and always supportive
              seniors to make these events successful .The society’s success
              makes me feel like I’ve achieved something and correspondingly the
              society’s failure as my failure. So it is my strong desire to give
              back to my society (family) coupled with the experience gained
              over this past year. I’ve a lot of plans of introducing a new
              branch which will widens the reach of Kalakriti among the masses.
              I believe if I am voted for the position I will work to bring new
              and innovative changes in Kalakriti. I’ve worked hard with
              Kalakriti and whatever I get as a post I’d be more than happy to
              accept it and work on it. Thank you

            <p>
              A desire to extend my knowledge and enthusiasm to work for
              Kalakriti motivated me to apply for this post. I believe that my
              experience has inculcated the required qualities to handle this
              responsibility in my character. Two years back, when I attended
              the orientation of Kalakriti, I instantly knew that I wanted to be
              a part of this society. Kalakriti has given me a platform to
              showcase my talent. Not only this, it has given me a chance to
              know and admire my seniors who have guided me in every way
              possible. I wish to become the same mentor to my juniors. I aim to
              do things differently. I will make sure that every member gets an
              equal opportunity to mark their talents through their artworks
              without any bias. Every member will be given a chance to bring in
              new ideas. I will make sure that everyone understands the concept
              of professionalism. Being one of the Co-heads of the Core Art
              team, I would like to extend my tenure as a member of the council
              and continue to show my inclination towards the welfare of this
              society. I sincerely hope that in the past year, I have done well
              enough to prove my capabilities in the best possible way.

            <p>
              I am Dhruv, COE 2nd Year. Currently I am PR coordinator at
              Kalakriti. I am standing for the position of President, Vice
              President and Secretary. Being a part of the society since my
              first semester itself Kalakriti has not just been just another
              society rather its a fam and I have cherished every moment spent
              together❤️❤️ The trust seniors showed in me by giving me various
              responsibilities was very valuable for me. Working for Kalakriti
              helped me a lot in gaining personal skills and also helping me
              interact with new people and making valuable connections. From a
              “text-only” person to calling 20 people a day (Calling is FUN 😂),
              explaining to them about our events and being a representative of
              such talented bunch of people have been a great deal of honour for
              me 🙌, and the swag of “Biggest Art Fest”/“Biggest Art Society” is
              an added bonus 😉. Not only that I gave my contribution for other
              events like Spinback, Spectrang, Webinars, E-summit, and the
              journey has been filled with so much fun. I also helped in making
              Kalakriti go ONLINE via our website and help get more exposure and
              reach more talents. Unfortunately, Due to the pandemic and
              university being closed, Abhivyakti’20 could not happen for which
              our seniors had so much planned out. But now we all can hope that
              we could have it this year and make it the Grandest Art Fest Ever
              🔥, together we all would take back all that was lost and in
              STYLE🥳 The positions for which I have applied to hold a great
              deal of responsibility, and I am willing to take that challenge as
              I feel I still have a lot left in me to contribute to this fam and
              what could be the better way ❤️🙌 These almost 2 years now had
              been so fun, enjoyable, sometimes stressful 😂 but in all so much
              memorable😍. Now If trusted and chosen by you guys , I promise to
              make sure that you never ever doubt that decision and also make
              Kalakriti bigger and on Another Level 🔥 as our seniors did every
              year and expect of us. Thankyou and I am forever grateful for
              being a part of this fam be it our seniors or now our juniors ❤️.
              I wish you all best of health and stay safe. 🙏🙌

            <p>
              As a part of the Kalakriti family, I have always tried to align my
              skills and knowledge in a way that helps both society and myself
              in growth. I like to believe that the work I complete even today
              is aligned with the expectations you have for me. When I think
              about my experience up until now whether it is from organizing
              fests, webinars, competitions to sitting all day at the OAT, I see
              how the individual hard work of each and every member starting
              from day zero has contributed to our goal to uphold the reputation
              and dignity of the society. The environment to work together
              irrespective of the seniority or the posts and creating a lovable
              place for everyone has always been the essence of Kalakriti, which
              I personally want to carry forward with the extremes of my
              abilities. Now when it is time to lead the future path I am
              applying for the posts of President and Vice-President, and hope
              to achieve benchmarks with your support and be one of the flag
              bearers with you. I hope to leverage the knowledge and sentiments
              that I have gained in these last couple of years, in the future as
              well. All the while, without stepping back from any of my duties
              either as your friend or as your senior. All this being said. I’d
              be honoured to work on new prospects and lead Kalakriti onto
              horizons never seen before.

              Hello everyone👋 I'm Nitish, mechanical 2nd-year student standing
              tall for the post of President, Vice President, and Secretary.
              I've been a part of kalakriti since the very first months of
              college and have worked enthusiastically ever since. Kalakriti has
              given me the most encouraging and friendly environment to make
              friends and refine my skills. Apart from the art skills and
              friends i've made kalakriti has also played an important role in
              my overall growth as a person.😌 I do look forward to work and
              come up with ideas for kalakriti , few of the ideas I had in mind
              are 1. More creative events (inspired from the art-e-mix) ².
              Competition and workshops for less popular art styles ( you never
              know what you are good at unless you try that). 3. Workshops for
              encouragement of our relatively newer fields.( eg music production
              ). 4. Plan outings and other interactive activities to encourage
              participation from less active members of the society. Looking
              back to these two years in kalakriti and observing all these
              amazing artists grow themselves while motivating others,I do get
              this feeling like “damn I soo want to become the president🥺 ”
              Just kidding .. but it sure is a privilege for whoever gets to
              lead the society If you choose to elect me I assure you I will
              always be a person you can count on for any work.(even if you
              don't you can still count on me 😘😂). And if now you have
              considered me for becoming the president you better get used to
              being high, society is about to reach new heights🤙😁. Lastly,
              looking forward to working with all of you (love you all❤️)

              a Volunteer to Operations Co-head. The college has been closed
              because of Covid, but we have organized many webinars and
              competitions and most of you have seen me working for it in every
              possible way. Working in Abhivyakti, E-cell, Spectrang, and many
              workshops in my first year, I continued to enjoy working with the
              fam in the second year, keeping myself involved in everything.
              Though we couldn’t have a proper meet-up with the juniors, I hope
              I have shared some bonds with many. It was all because of a sense
              of belonging that I share with my seniors, I was able to devote my
              time to Kalakriti and wish to continue it. If the ongoing
              conditions become better, I am sure I am going to make Abhivyakti
              even bigger this time with you all. The promises are not something
              I rely on, but the work that I have continued since my first year
              and to date. If I am chosen as President or VP, I will continue to
              work dedicatedly and achieve new heights for society. Lastly,
              Thank you to all the seniors who made me a part of this family.

            <h1>Sanket Barman</h1>
            <p>
              Hello Everyone! I, Sanket Barman, COE-2ND year, is contesting for
              the position of Vice President/General Secretary/Joint Secretary
              of Kalakriti. I have been a part of this society since the day I
              began my college life, when I was just a clueless student and had
              no idea of how joining this society will turn out to be my best
              decision in college by far. These two years have been great and
              now it will be a gratitude to serve this family as a head. In the
              last year, amidst the pandemic, talking to you guys and working
              altogether for the events was the only source of recreation for
              me. By being a part of the core council, I’ll get a chance to
              represent the views of my peers, take the best possible decision
              and most importantly I’ll get to interact with everyone and build
              relations which I will cherish forever. I shall be friendly and
              unbiased so that no one hesitates to share their problems with me.
              Before taking any decision, I’ll perfectly analyze all the pros
              and cons of the situations possible. I’ll also take the doubts and
              suggestions of my peers into consideration before coming to a
              decision. I consider this thoughtful decision making as one of my
              key assets which I think makes me a distinguished and deserving
              candidate. Starting from Abhiyakti to these online events, I will
              cherish every second I spent as a member of this society. I have
              seen this society growing over the last years and wish to take it
              to heights in the upcoming years as well. But this wouldn’t be
              possible without your support. You guys have always supported me,
              and I am sure you will support me this time as well. I would
              highly appreciate your support for the same. Looking forward to a
              superb year with you all!

            <p>
              Being part of the ever-growing KALAKRITI family for over a year, I
              see this as an opportunity to show my appreciation for the society
              and continue to contribute towards the growth of the society. As
              part of a team of highly creative people, I aim to create an
              environment of easy communication and a safe space to foster
              proactive discussions. If given the opportunity, I aim to be an
              approachable and unbiased authority to eliminate hesitancy in
              interaction. I believe my transferrable skills such as teamwork,
              conflict management, communication and organization skills make me
              a competent candidate. I firmly believe that I have a vital and
              well-resolved decision making capability. I'm a team player and
              strive to ensure all suggestions are considered before any
              decision. I, Smahi Khare, if elected for the council post, will
              fulfil all my responsibilities to the best possible extent. I look
              forward to the challenges and the opportunity.

            <h1>Yati Sharma</h1>
            <p>
              I am Yati Sharma, a fourth-semester undergraduate design student
              seeking to use creativity, skills and design thinking to generate
              distinctive experiences. Being an art enthusiast, I gained
              industrial experience in visual designing through internships one
              of which was in the National Gallery of Modern Art, New Delhi that
              has completely changed my perspective to perceive creative art
              form and has reshaped my work in a new refined manner. Because of
              working in a professional setting, I have learned how to formulate
              a strategy and get the work to its successful completion. I have
              been a member of Kalakriti for two years now and have completed
              various tasks assigned to me. As I have a design background and
              skillset, I feel that my further association with Kalakriti as a
              core committee member will help in making it stand out
              continuously among all the contemporaries. Also working in the
              core committee, will help me understand the management of a
              proficiently working organization and will contribute to my
              personal growth. This continuous association has brought a defined
              maturity in my work and I am thankful for this opportunity. If
              voted for a position, I will strive to use my full potential for
              the advancement of our society. Thank you…
